This is a directory for local data.

It contains our content info as flat JSON files, keyed by ID.
(Note: uppercase letters get an underscore prefix, to work around
case-insensitive filesystems.)

**TEMP:** We are temporarily checking some sample data into the git repo,
in order to test lookups of existing URLs (that are known in the local db).
We can/should remove these files (and update our tests) once we have
new content acceptance hooked up.
