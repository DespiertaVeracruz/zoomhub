An open-source cloud service for viewing arbitrarily hi-res zoomable images.

Inspired by, and has taken over, the similar former Microsoft service
**[Zoom.it](http://zoom.it/)**.
This is a full from-scratch rewrite, brought to you by the same developers who
built the original Zoom.it.


## Usage

This service is running live at **[zoom.it](http://zoom.it/)**.
We aren't accepting any new content for now, but all old Zoom.it content
should continue to work.

This service also includes a REST API, available at **`api.zoom.it`**
(e.g. [`/v1/content/4rcn`](http://api.zoom.it/v1/content/4rcn)),
which includes most of the functionality from the original Zoom.it API.
For details and API documentation, see **[API.md](./API.md)**.

You can also run this code and host the service on your own.
The codebase is still a work-in-progress, and probably a bit tied to our own
deployment currently, but we can try to help you if you need.

If you wish to run this on your own, or to contribute to our development,
please see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** for instructions.
